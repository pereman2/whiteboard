##Easiest setup

`npm install`

then run:

`npm start`

## why 

I wanted to make a board, a dataconnection and video connection from 0 and it was a pain in the ass
since webrtc without a framework sucks ass.

Video and data doesn't work now because i was trying something new and it exploded and I don't want to touch this ever again.

I dare you, dont touch this, it's for your own sanity.
